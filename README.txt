README
This package implements the deep tranductive learning for semi-supervised clusteirng. 
Two key files are:
dtmmc_constrains.m --- generalized the pairwise constraints
dtmmc_gradient_update.m --- computer the gradient and update the parameters

To test the code, the user can run dtmmc_demo_coil100.m


For more details about the model please refer to:
